# MazeGen
Converts Daedalus (hyper)maze bitmap images to Minecraft schematics

## Background
When trying to find if 3D mazes exist, I tried for a long time to find a generator for them but found no success until I stumbled upon [Daedalus](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm), a FOSS maze generator that only outputs in black-and-white bitmap images. So with the power of C#, I took it upon myself to use some NBT API and image reader API to make a program that converts Daedalus bitmap images to Minecraft schematics to import on my server with WorldEdit.

If you want to see some results, either compile it yourself or message me and join my server at mc.nqind.com.
